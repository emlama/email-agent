3. **`email-workflow.ts`**: Workflow manager implementing priority-based triage
4. **Updated `index.ts`**: Integration with existing Gmail tools

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Initialize classifier
const classifier = new EmailClassifier(apiKey);

// Classify single email
const result = await classifier.classifyEmail(emailData);

// Batch classification
const results = await classifier.classifyEmailBatch(emails);

// Run complete workflow
const workflowManager = new EmailWorkflowManager(apiKey, readline);
await workflowManager.processInboxWorkflow(emails);
```

### Integration with Gmail Tools

The system integrates with existing Gmail tools to:
- Fetch emails for classification
- Apply labels based on categories
